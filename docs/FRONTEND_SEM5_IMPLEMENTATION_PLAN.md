- **Real-time Updates:** Live updates for group formation and allocation
- **Notification System:** Group invitations, faculty responses

## Sem 5 Workflow Analysis

### Student Journey (Complete Workflow)
1. **Login** → Student Dashboard (Sem 5 specific)
2. **Minor Project 2 Registration** → Fill basic details → Submit
3. **Group Formation** → Create group → Invite members → Wait for responses
4. **Member Management** → Accept/reject invitations → Manage group roles
5. **Project Details** → Group leader fills project details → Submit
6. **Faculty Preferences** → Select faculty preferences → Submit
7. **Allocation Waiting** → Monitor allocation status → Wait for faculty response
8. **Group Dashboard** → View allocated faculty → Start project work

### Faculty Journey
1. **Faculty Dashboard** → View allocation requests (Choose/Pass tabs)
2. **Group Review** → Review group details → Make decision
3. **Choose/Pass Decision** → Accept group OR pass to next preference
4. **Allocated Groups** → Manage accepted groups → Monitor progress

### Admin Journey
1. **Admin Dashboard** → Sem 5 group overview and statistics
2. **Group Management** → View all groups → Monitor formation status
3. **Unallocated Groups** → Manually assign faculty to rejected groups
4. **System Configuration** → Set group limits, faculty preferences, faculty types
