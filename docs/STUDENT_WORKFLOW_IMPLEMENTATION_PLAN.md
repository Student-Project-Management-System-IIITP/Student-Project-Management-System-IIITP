# Student Workflow Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Student Project Management System (SPMS) at IIIT Pune. The system handles complex workflows for both B.Tech and M.Tech students across different semesters, with varying project types, group formations, and faculty allocations.

## Current System Status

### ✅ What We Have
- **Core Models:** User, Student, Faculty, Admin models with consistent structure
- **Project Management Models:** Project, Group, FacultyPreference models with full functionality
- **Enhanced Student Model:** Project references, group memberships, internship tracking, semester status
- **System Configuration:** Dynamic configuration system for admin-managed settings
- **Authentication System:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- **Database Structure:** Complete with relationships, indexes, and validation
- **Business Logic:** Comprehensive methods for project, group, and faculty management
- **Frontend Structure:** Complete Sem 4 student workflow with dynamic dashboard, project registration, and PPT upload

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Admin Frontend:** Evaluation management interface for admins
- **Faculty Frontend:** Evaluation interface for faculty
- **Semester-Specific Workflows:** Implementation of other semester workflows (Sem 5-8, M.Tech)
- **Faculty Allocation System:** Complete faculty preference and allocation workflow
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing suite
- **Documentation:** API documentation and user guides
